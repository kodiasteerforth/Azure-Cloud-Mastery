# Introduction to App Service Monitoring

App Service Monitoring allows you to monitor and track the performance and behavior of your applications hosted in Azure App Service. It provides various features to help you gain insights into the resource usage, metrics, diagnostics, and logs of your applications.

## Quotas

Quotas are limits imposed on the resources that your applications can utilize within the App Service plan. The specific quotas depend on the type of App Service plan associated with your app. Some common quotas include:

- CPU (Short): Limits the CPU usage for a short period of time.
- CPU (Day): Limits the CPU usage over a day.
- Memory: Restricts the amount of memory your app can consume.
- Bandwidth: Sets a cap on the amount of data transferred to and from your app.
- Filesystem: Applicable only to Basic, Standard, and Premium plans, it defines the maximum storage capacity for your app's files.

## Metrics

Metrics provide information about the behavior and performance of your app or the App Service plan it is hosted on. There are different categories of metrics available:

- App Service Plan Metrics: These metrics include CPU and memory percentage, data in/out, disk queue length, and HTTP queue length for the entire App Service plan.
- Application Metrics: These metrics pertain specifically to your application and can include average response time, average memory working set, CPU time, data in/out, HTTP status codes, and request counts, among others.

The granularity and retention of metrics vary. Minute granularity metrics are retained for 30 hours, hour granularity metrics for 30 days, and day granularity metrics for 30 days.

## Diagnostics

App Service web apps provide diagnostic functionality to log information from both the web server and the web application. This helps in troubleshooting and monitoring the health of your application. Diagnostics are divided into two categories:

- Web Server Diagnostics: This includes detailed error logging, failed request tracking, and web server logging. These diagnostics provide insights into the behavior of the underlying web server hosting your app.
- Application Diagnostics: Application diagnostics allow you to capture information generated by your web application. You can configure the level of detail to log and choose whether to store the diagnostic information in the file system or Azure storage.

## Stream Logs

During the development of an application, it can be valuable to view logging information in near-real time. App Service allows you to stream logs to your development environment using Azure PowerShell or the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI). You can filter the logs based on specific criteria, such as error messages. Examples of streaming logs using Azure PowerShell and the Azure CLI are provided.

By utilizing these monitoring features, you can gain valuable insights into the performance, resource usage, and diagnostics of your applications hosted in Azure App Service, allowing you to optimize and troubleshoot as needed.
