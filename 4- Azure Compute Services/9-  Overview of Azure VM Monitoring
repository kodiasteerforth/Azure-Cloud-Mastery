# Overview of Azure VM Monitoring
Azure provides various monitoring capabilities to track the performance, health, and diagnostics of virtual machines (VMs) deployed in the Azure cloud. Here's an overview of key components and features:

## Diagnostics and Metrics
- Activity Log: Azure captures an activity log that allows you to audit and review the operations performed on your VMs, providing visibility into changes and actions taken.
- Base Metrics: Azure Monitor provides a set of base metrics for VMs, including CPU usage, memory utilization, disk performance, and network traffic. These metrics help you monitor the performance and health of your VMs.
- Boot Diagnostics: You can enable the collection of boot diagnostics for your VMs, which captures console output and screenshots during the boot process. This feature helps troubleshoot boot failures and understand the VM's initialization.
- Guest OS Diagnostics: Azure enables the collection of guest OS diagnostics data, which includes performance counters, event logs, and other diagnostic information from the VM's operating system. This data can be analyzed and visualized using services like Azure Log Analytics or Azure Monitor.

## Alerts
Azure provides an alerting mechanism that allows you to set up notifications based on specific conditions and thresholds. You can create alerts based on metrics, activity logs, or health states of your VMs. When an alert is triggered, you can receive notifications via various channels, such as email, SMS, or integration with third-party tools.

## Health
- Azure Service Health: Azure Service Health provides timely and personalized information about the health of Azure services. It notifies you about service issues, planned maintenance, and other events that may impact your VMs or other Azure resources.
- Azure Resource Health: Resource Health helps you diagnose and get support when an Azure issue affects your resources. It provides information on the current and past health status of your VMs and other Azure resources. It also offers troubleshooting steps and connects you with Azure support if needed.

## Advanced Monitoring
- Operations Management Suite (OMS): OMS is a comprehensive monitoring and management solution that provides monitoring, alerting, and remediation capabilities across cloud and on-premises assets. It offers features such as log analytics, automation, and advanced alerting.
- Log Analytics: Azure Log Analytics collects and analyzes data generated by various resources in your cloud and on-premises environments. It allows you to perform advanced analysis, create custom queries, and visualize data from multiple sources, including VMs.
- Network Watcher: Network Watcher is a network monitoring and diagnostics service that helps monitor the network connectivity and performance of your VMs. It allows you to capture packet-level data, analyze network traffic, and troubleshoot network issues.

By leveraging these monitoring capabilities, you can gain insights into the performance, health, and diagnostics of your Azure VMs. This enables proactive monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimization of your VMs to ensure their availability and optimal performance.
