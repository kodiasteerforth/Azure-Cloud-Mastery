# Peering
Virtual network peering allows you to establish connections between two virtual networks, either within the same region (VNet peering) or across different regions (Global VNet peering).

# Connectivity
## Seamless connectivity
- When virtual machines are located in peered virtual networks, the traffic between them is routed directly through Microsoft's backbone infrastructure. This means the traffic doesn't need to go through a gateway or traverse the public Internet.
- Network security groups can be applied within either virtual network to control access and block traffic between virtual networks or subnets if necessary.

# Service Chaining
## Hub and Spoke
- You can set up hub-and-spoke network architectures, where the hub virtual network acts as a central point and can host infrastructure components like network virtual appliances or VPN gateways.
- Spoke virtual networks can be peered with the hub virtual network, enabling traffic to flow through the network virtual appliances or VPN gateways located in the hub virtual network.

## Gateway and on-premise Connectivity
### Gateway Transit
- When virtual networks are peered, you have the option to configure the gateway in the peered virtual network as a transit point to connect with an on-premises network.
- Gateway transit is supported for both VNet peering and Global VNet peering scenarios.

# Peering Scenarios
- Peering between virtual networks within the same subscription is allowed.
- Peering between virtual networks in different subscriptions under the same Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant is permitted.
- Peering between virtual networks in different subscriptions located in different AD tenants is also supported.

These connectivity scenarios enable you to establish secure and efficient communication between virtual networks, whether they are located within the same region or across different regions or subscriptions.
