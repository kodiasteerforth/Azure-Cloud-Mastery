Azure is Microsoft's public cloud platform. Azure offers a large collection of services, which includes platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and managed database service capabilities. However, what exactly is Azure, and how does it work?

# Infrastructure
Azure operates through a global network of data centers located in different regions worldwide. These data centers house servers, storage systems, networking equipment, and other infrastructure components that power the Azure platform. The infrastructure is designed to provide high availability, scalability, and reliability for hosting applications and storing data.

# Virtualization
Azure uses virtualization technology to create virtual machines (VMs) and virtual networks. Virtualization enables the abstraction of physical hardware, allowing multiple virtual instances to run on a single physical server. This virtualization layer provides the foundation for deploying and managing various resources in Azure.

# Resource Provisioning
Azure allows users to provision resources based on their needs. Resources can include virtual machines, storage accounts, databases, networking components, and more. Users can choose the specifications, such as compute power, storage capacity, and network configurations, and Azure provisions these resources in a matter of minutes.

# Management and Control
Azure provides a centralized management interface called Azure Portal, where users can create, configure, and manage their resources. Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the underlying service that enables resource deployment, management, and orchestration. ARM allows users to define their infrastructure as code using ARM templates for repeatable and automated deployments.

# Service Offerings
Azure offers a wide range of services and solutions that cater to different requirements. These services include compute services (such as virtual machines and serverless computing), storage services (like blob storage and databases), networking services (virtual networks and load balancers), analytics services (data processing and machine learning), and more. Users can choose the services they need and provision them within their Azure environment.

# Scalability and Elasticity
Azure provides the ability to scale resources up or down based on demand. Users can increase or decrease the number of virtual machines, adjust storage capacity, or scale their applications horizontally to handle varying workloads. This scalability allows users to optimize resource usage and cost-effectively handle peak periods.

# Integration and Hybrid Capabilities
Azure offers integration with on-premises infrastructure, enabling hybrid scenarios. Organizations can connect their existing systems and applications with Azure services through secure virtual private networks (VPNs) or dedicated connectivity options like Azure ExpressRoute. This integration allows businesses to extend their on-premises infrastructure to the cloud and leverage the benefits of Azure while maintaining existing investments.

# Security and Compliance
Azure prioritizes security and compliance. It implements robust security measures, including data encryption at rest and in transit, identity and access management controls, and security monitoring and threat detection services. Azure also complies with a wide range of industry standards and regulations to ensure data privacy and compliance requirements are met.

# Pricing and Billing
Azure operates on a pay-as-you-go pricing model. Users are billed based on their resource consumption, such as the number of virtual machines, storage capacity used, and data transfer. Azure provides various pricing options and plans to suit different needs, including reserved instances, cost management tools, and budgeting capabilities.

Overall, Azure provides a comprehensive cloud computing platform that enables users to build, deploy, and manage applications and services with flexibility, scalability, and reliability. It abstracts the complexities of infrastructure management, allowing users to focus on their core business goals while leveraging the power of the cloud.

# AZURE TERMINOLOGY 

It's helpful to know the following definitions as you begin your Azure cloud adoption journey:

# Resource
An entity that's managed by Azure. Examples include Azure Virtual Machines, virtual networks, and storage accounts.

# Subscription
A logical container for your resources. Each Azure resource is associated with only one subscription. Creating a subscription is the first step in adopting Azure.

# Azure account 
The email address that you provide when you create an Azure subscription is the Azure account for the subscription. The party that's associated with the email account is responsible for the monthly costs incurred by the resources in the subscription. When you create an Azure account, you provide contact information and billing details, like a credit card. You can use the same Azure account for multiple subscriptions. Each subscription is associated with only one Azure account.

# Account administrator
The party associated with the email address that's used to create an Azure subscription. The account administrator is responsible for paying for all costs that incur by the subscription's resources.

# Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
The Microsoft cloud-based identity and access management service. Azure AD lets your employees sign in and access resources.

# Azure AD tenant
A dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD. When your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription, it automatically creates an Azure AD tenant. For example, Microsoft Azure, Intune, or Microsoft 365. An Azure tenant represents a single organization.

# Azure AD directory
Each Azure AD tenant has a single, dedicated, and trusted directory. The directory includes the tenant's users, groups, and applications. Use the directory to manage identity and access management functions for tenant resources. You can associate a directory with multiple subscriptions but each subscription is associated with only one directory.

# Resource groups
Logical containers that you use to group related resources in a subscription. Each resource can exist in only one resource group. Resource groups allow for more granular grouping within a subscription. They're commonly used to represent a collection of assets that are required to support a workload, application, or specific function within a subscription.

# Management groups
Logical containers that you use for one or more subscriptions. You can define a hierarchy of management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance through inheritance.

# Region
A set of Azure datacenters that deploy inside a latency-defined perimeter. The datacenters connect through a dedicated, regional, low-latency network. Most Azure resources run in a specific Azure region.

# AZURE SUBSCRIPTION PURPOSES

An Azure subscription serves several purposes, such as:

# A legal agreement
Each subscription is associated with an Azure offer, like a free trial or pay-as-you-go. Each offer provides a specific rate plan, benefits, and associated terms and conditions. Choose an Azure offer when you create a subscription.

# A payment agreement
When you create a subscription, you provide payment information for that subscription, such as a credit card number. Each month, the costs that incur by the resources deployed to the subscription are calculated and billed to that payment method.

# A boundary of scale
Scale limits you define for a subscription. The subscription's resources can't exceed the set scale limits. For example, there's a limit on the number of virtual machines that you can create in a single subscription.

# An administrative boundary
A subscription can act as a boundary for administration, security, and policy. Azure also provides other mechanisms to meet these needs, such as management groups, resource groups, and Azure role-based access control.

# AZURE SUBSCRIPTION CONSIDERATIONS 

When you create an Azure subscription, you make several key choices about the subscription:

# Who is responsible for paying for the subscription? 
By default, the account administrator is the person associated with the email address that you provide when you create a subscription. This person is responsible for paying for all costs incurred by the subscription's resources.

# Which Azure offer am I interested in?
Each subscription is associated with a specific Azure offer. You can choose the Azure offer that best meets your needs. For example, if you intend to use a subscription to run non-production workloads, you might choose the Pay-As-You-Go Dev/Test offer, or the Enterprise Dev/Test offer.

# NB - When you sign up for Azure, you might see the phrase Create an Azure account. You create an Azure account when you create an Azure subscription. You can associate the subscription with an email account.

# AZURE ADMINISTRATIVE ROLES 

Azure defines three types of roles for administering subscriptions, identities, and resources:

Classic subscription administrator roles
Azure roles
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) roles

The account administrator role is assigned to the email account that's used to create the Azure subscription. The account administrator is the billing owner of the subscription. The account administrator can manage subscription administrators in the Azure portal.

By default, the service administrator role for a subscription is also assigned to the email account that's used to create the Azure subscription. The service administrator has permissions to the subscription equivalent to the Azure role-based access control Owner role. The service administrator also has full access to the Azure portal. The account administrator can change the service administrator to a different email account.

When you create an Azure subscription, you can associate it with an existing Azure AD tenant. Otherwise, creating a new subscription creates a new Azure AD tenant with an associated directory. Assign the global administrator role in the Azure AD to the email account used to create the Azure AD subscription.

You can associate an email account with multiple Azure subscriptions. An account administrator can transfer a subscription to another account.

# SUBSCRIPTIONS & REGIONS 

Every Azure resource is logically associated with one subscription. When you create a resource, you choose which Azure subscription to deploy that resource to. You can move a resource to another subscription later.

Subscriptions aren't tied to a specific Azure region, but each Azure resource deploys to only one region. You can have resources in multiple regions that are associated with the same subscription.

# NB - Most Azure resources deploy to a specific region. Certain resource types are considered global resources, such as policies that you set by using the Azure Policy services.
