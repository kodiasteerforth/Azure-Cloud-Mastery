Here's a 10,000 feet view of Azure services, covering management tools, EAI (Enterprise Application Integration), developer tools, IoT (Internet of Things), storage, network, databases, compute, analytics, app services, and security:

# Management Tools
Azure provides various management tools to simplify the management and monitoring of Azure resources. Azure Portal is a web-based interface for managing and monitoring resources, Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI are command-line tools for scripting and automation, and Azure Resource Manager enables template-based resource deployment and management.

# EAI (Enterprise Application Integration)
Azure offers services for integrating and connecting applications and systems. Azure Logic Apps provides a visual workflow designer for orchestrating and automating business processes, while Azure Service Bus facilitates reliable messaging between applications and services.

# Developer Tools
Azure provides a range of developer tools and services. Azure DevOps enables end-to-end application lifecycle management, including source control, build and release pipelines, and project management. Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio IDEs offer rich development environments, and Azure Functions enables serverless computing for event-driven applications.

# IoT (Internet of Things)
Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed service for connecting, monitoring, and managing IoT devices at scale. It provides device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messaging, device provisioning, and device management capabilities. Azure IoT Central offers a low-code approach for building and managing IoT solutions.

# Security
Azure provides robust security services and features to protect data and applications. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) offers identity and access management capabilities, Azure Security Center provides threat detection and monitoring, and Azure Sentinel is a cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM) service.

# Storage
Azure offers a variety of storage services to meet different data storage needs. Azure Blob Storage is for storing unstructured data like images and documents, Azure Files provides file sharing over SMB protocol, and Azure Disk Storage offers durable and high-performance block storage for virtual machines.

# Network
Azure provides networking services to connect resources and create secure networks. Azure Virtual Network enables the creation of isolated network environments, Azure Load Balancer distributes incoming network traffic, and Azure VPN Gateway provides secure connectivity between on-premises networks and Azure.

# Databases
Azure offers various database services to cater to different data management needs. Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service, Azure Cosmos DB provides globally distributed NoSQL databases, and Azure Database for MySQL and Azure Database for PostgreSQL offer managed open-source database solutions.

# Compute
Azure offers compute services for running applications and workloads. Azure Virtual Machines provides scalable virtual machine instances, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) allows for easy management of containerized applications, and Azure Functions enables serverless computing for executing code in response to events.

# Analytics
Azure provides analytics services for processing and analyzing data. Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly Azure SQL Data Warehouse) offers an analytics and data warehousing solution, Azure HDInsight enables big data processing with popular frameworks, and Azure Databricks provides collaborative analytics workspaces.

# App Services
Azure App Service is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering for building and deploying web, mobile, and API applications. It supports various programming languages, frameworks, and deployment options, allowing developers to focus on application logic without worrying about underlying infrastructure.

# Security
Azure offers a wide range of security services to protect data and applications. Azure Key Vault enables secure storage and management of cryptographic keys and secrets, Azure Active Directory provides identity and access management capabilities, and Azure DDoS Protection safeguards against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

These are just some key examples of Azure services in each category. Azure's portfolio is extensive and continually expanding, offering a wide range of services to meet various business needs and enable organizations to build, deploy, and manage applications and services in a flexible and scalable manner.
